## Tests

When creating new features, please add unit tests as they help other 
developers understand the use case of the particular feature. 
It also incentivizes developers to write code that is easy to debug 
and robust.

For writing tests in a python file, please prefix the file as `test_{src_file_name}.py`. 
For example, test file for `app.py` will be `test_app.py`
